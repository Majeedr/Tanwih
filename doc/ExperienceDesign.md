# User Experience Design
Note: Please using user friendly words and abbrev here.

## Consideration
Looking at 

## Tanwih Flow
### Collection
Once users start Tanwih, they will see screen contains collection of tanwih, as list. They can scroll up and down, see the one which they prefer. At a glance, they also can see which one has been published and which one is mangling with no design.

> Unpublished tanwih is easily recognized.

When they will decide which one to design, they can sort it up, filter, or just scroll them.

> Add filter and sort feature





## Navigation
### Opening list item (tanwih)
When open an item, by default it show Tanwih Item read-only, not editing mode.
